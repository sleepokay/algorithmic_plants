# Algorithmic Plants

![alt tag](media/sample.gif)

A visualization of plant-like forms generated by Lindenmayer systems. An L-System consists of a seed string and a set of production rules which expand a symbol into a longer string of symbols. By repeatedly applying the production rules, we can generate a longer and longer string, while the recursive nature of this process leads to self-similarity, and thereby fractal-like forms. Interpreting the resultant string as instructions for a graphical "turtle" allows us to visualize the L-System.
