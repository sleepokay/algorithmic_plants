# Algorithmic Plants

![alt tag](media/sample.gif)

A visualization of plant-like forms generated by Lindenmayer systems. An L-System consists of a seed string and a set of production rules which expand a symbol into a longer string of symbols. By repeatedly applying the production rules, we can generate a longer and longer string, whose recursive nature leads to self-similarity and fractal-like forms. Interpreting the result of this process as a sequence of instructions for a graphical "turtle" allows us to draw the L-System.
